  <h2>Who We Are</h2>
  <p>
    Free Image Resizer started with a simple idea — image editing should be fast,
    private, and available to everyone. We noticed that most online tools upload
    your pictures to unknown servers, add watermarks, force sign-ups, or hide
    basic features behind subscriptions. We wanted to build something better.
  </p>

  <p>
    So we created a lightweight, secure, and 100% browser-based image editor that
    respects your privacy and doesn’t store a single byte of your data.
  </p>

  <h3>Our Mission</h3>
  <p>
    Our mission is to make everyday image editing effortless. Whether you’re a
    student submitting an assignment, a designer optimizing images for a website,
    or someone who simply needs to compress a photo before uploading it – we want
    to give you a tool that works instantly, without complications.
  </p>

  <h3>Why We Built This Tool</h3>
  <p>
    We built Free Image Resizer because we believe in:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Your images never leave your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Everything runs locally with zero upload time.</li>
    <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> No ads, no sign-ups, no confusing menus.</li>
    <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Works on mobile, desktop, and tablets.</li>
    <li><strong>Quality:</strong> Industry-standard compression and resizing algorithms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Our Vision</h3>
  <p>
    We want to become the most trusted online image optimization platform in the
    world — the tool people rely on because it's simple, transparent, and built
    with the user in mind. Technology should make things easier, not more
    complicated, and we aim to embody that philosophy in everything we build.
  </p>

  <h3>Our Core Values</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Honesty:</strong> No hidden tracking, no data collection.</li>
    <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Tools that save time and reduce friction.</li>
    <li><strong>Innovation:</strong> Smart features without unnecessary complexity.</li>
    <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> The tool should “just work,” every time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Behind the Tool</h3>
  <p>
    Free Image Resizer is developed by a small team of passionate engineers and
    designers who believe that privacy-friendly tools are the future of the web.
    We focus heavily on performance, clean UI, and seamless user experience.
  </p>

  <h3>What Makes Us Different?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>No files are uploaded — processing is 100% local</li>
    <li>No analytics, no trackers, no hidden scripts</li>
    <li>No watermark on images</li>
    <li>No ads interrupting your workflow</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Our Commitment to Privacy</h3>
  <p>
    Privacy is not a feature for us — it’s a foundation. Your images, your data,
    your editing history, and your browser activity remain completely yours.
  </p>

  <h3>Future Plans</h3>
  <p>
    As we grow, we plan to introduce smart AI-based enhancements, batch
    processing, premium filters, and support for more formats — always while
    keeping everything local inside your browser without storing any user data.
  </p>

  <h3>Thank You for Being Here</h3>
  <p>
    Whether you're a first-time visitor or a regular user, we appreciate you.  
    Your trust motivates us to keep improving and offering tools that genuinely
    help people.
